# Open positions

<!-- **Note: We currently have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. We can only welcome you if you have a fellowship. I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [veni fellowship](https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme-veni-science-domain) or the Marie Curie fellowship (currently closed, next deadline probably Fall 2021, [here is last years call]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/h2020-wp1820-msca_en.pdf)).**

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

We currently have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of language models, multi-omics data, exon- and transcript-level mappings and isoform-level gene expression and regulation. You will be involved in analyzing huge multi-omics data, performing NSG analysis and developing AI-based model to get the biological insights from those data.
